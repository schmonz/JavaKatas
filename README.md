# JavaKatas

A place to practice our Java and learn from each other.

# How to exercise

We want to be able to compare our solutions, so do your work on
each kata in a subdirectory. Push whenever you like (and/or whenever
you can ;-).

# How to add another kata

Make a well-named top-level directory and put the kata description
in a `README`. Commit and push.
