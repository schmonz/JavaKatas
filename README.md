# JavaKatas

A place to practice our Java and learn from each other.

# How to exercise

We want to be able to compare our solutions, so do your work on a
non-`master` branch. Push whenever you like (and/or whenever you
can ;-).

# How to add another kata

On `master`, make a well-named subdirectory and put the kata
description in a `README`. Commit and push. Then checkout your
branch and hack away.
